There was once a a giraffe in the rain forest. His name was tom. Tom wasn't a normal giraffe though. He was very short. Tom didn't let that stop him from following his dreams though! Tom truly wished he could be like the other giraffes and stretch his neck into the canopy above. He tried stilts, paying off a gorilla to hold him up all day, and even by ordering growth pills online! Alas, nothing seemed to be able to help Tom.
