There was once a a giraffe in the rain forest. His name was tom. Tom wasn't a normal giraffe though. He was very short. Tom didn't let that stop him from following his dreams though! Tom
truly wished he could be like the other giraffes and stretch his neck into the canopy above. He tried stilts, paying off a gorilla to hold him up all day, and even by ordering growth pills 
online! Alas, nothing seemed to be able to help Tom. Tom tried and tried, spending many months on his attempt to reach the canopy. Each failure dragged down his spirits a little more each
time. Finally, he was ready to give up and accept his life eating from the lowest of branches. Just as Tom was about to head back and tell the others, a strange monkey wandered up to him.
The monkey, seeing Tom struggle, grabbed a strange looking fruit from up in the canopy and came back down to Tom. Without a word, the monkey broke open the fruit and painted a symbol on
Tom's short neck with the juice from inside the fruit. Within seconds, Tom could start to feel something happening. His neck grew and grew until it was reaching the tallest of trees with the most lucious of leaves. Tom turned to thank the monkey, but just as mysetiously as he came, he disappeared. Tom told himself that he would never forget the kind deed performed for him and lived the rest of his life as a normal-sized giraffe with an extra big heart from his turmoils.
